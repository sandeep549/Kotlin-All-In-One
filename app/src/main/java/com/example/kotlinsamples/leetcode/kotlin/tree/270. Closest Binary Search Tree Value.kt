/**
 * Explanation for solution:
 * To find closet value, we need max-lower-value and min-upper-value available in BST for the target.
 * If we search BST for given target using binary search approach, at every node we cut down the input space
 * by setting either a new lower/upper bound for target.
 * If target is less than node, then we set new upper bound, otherwise new lower bound. This way we go till leaf
 * node and both bound would have come max possible close to each other.
 * As we are calculating closet every time, we will get closet of either of them at the end.
