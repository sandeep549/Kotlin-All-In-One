Things that are annoying or need to be take care while coding in kotlin
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Need to add !! operator at un-necessary places where I'm sure that variable is not null at all.
   Seems like, to avoid NPE, lot of checking is enabled and that's creating this nuisance.

2. Function parameter are by default val and can not modified within function, due to which redeclaration 
    is required, which create verbosity and spoils that idea of kotlin to reduce verbosity.
