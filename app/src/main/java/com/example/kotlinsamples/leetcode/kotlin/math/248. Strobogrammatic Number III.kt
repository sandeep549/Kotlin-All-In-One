/**
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

Example:

Input: low = "50", high = "100"
Output: 3
Explanation: 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.
Note:
Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are represented as string.
